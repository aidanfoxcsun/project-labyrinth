# Goals
We are inspired by games like *The Binding of Isaac* and want to try our hands at the endless possibilities of a Roguelike.

## Procedural Generation
Like any good roguelike, we need the game to be endlessly replayable, providing a new experience every time you load up the application. What this means, in practice, is procedural level generation, with items, enemies and rooms placed randomly, determined by a seed.
